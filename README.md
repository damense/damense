### DaMenSe Profile

-   At the moment I'm figuring out how to make a cool profile in GitHub so be patient, cool stuff will come to those who wait. If you're curious at my achievements as a professional human person don't hesitate to check my [CV](https://damense.github.io/)

-   I'm in for any pharma, map or dataviz shenanigans. Love the intersections of all of those amongst each other and with queernes. Mainly an R user but I have a past with Matlab and a hate-hate relationship with Visual Basic.
